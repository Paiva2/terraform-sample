# Terraform Study Project with SNS, SQS, and EC2

This is a **study project** to practice using **Terraform** for provisioning AWS resources. The main goals are:

- Creating an **EC2 instance**
- Setting up an **SNS Topic** for sending messages
- Creating an **SQS Queue** that receives messages from the SNS Topic
- Integrating these resources in a simple way, without focusing on production-level best practices

> ⚠️ This project is for **learning purposes only**. Security, redundancy, and best practices are not considered.
